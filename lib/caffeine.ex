    The structure of the stream

    Though it could be more of an ADT there are no `hold/1` and `release/1` macros with which to build a constructor (yet).
    A plain old anonymous function and an `apply/2` suffice for the time being at least ğŸ™‚
    The list `[]` acts as the sentinel for the stream too.
